### Project Overview
> To Develop an application that provides a list of items in a AWS S3 bucket as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to UPLOAD, DOWNLOAD and DELETE their own items in the BUCKET. The project also uses throttling for  various API's call rate.

### Why This Project?
> Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing features and utilities to their users; but deep down, itâ€™s really all just creating, reading, updating and deleting data. In this project, I combined my knowledge of building dynamic websites with persistent data storage to create a web application that provides a compelling service to your users.

### What Did I Learn?
  * Develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask
  * Implementing Flask-login and Flask-jwt-extended for security.
  * Implementing UPLOAD, DOWNLOAD and DELETE in a S3 bucket.
  * Throttling for API call rate
  * Responsive UI
